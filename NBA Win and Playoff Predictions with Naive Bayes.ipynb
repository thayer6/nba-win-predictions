    "## Forecasting How Individual NBA Player Attributes Can Predict Whether Their Team Wins Enough to Make the Playoffs with Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I apply a Naive Bayes model to a NBA dataset from the Kaggle data repository (https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba). The dataset is titled \"Social Power NBA\" and contains performance, salary, and twitter data for 100 NBA players of the 2016-2017 season. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine a cut-off number of wins that would be required to make the playoffs, I took a look at the FiveThirtyEight predictions for the NBA playoffs (link) and decided that at least 42 regular season wins are required to reach the playoffs for a given team. I chose this number also because it is a good measure of a winning team and is used as a benchmark of sucess in the NBA, since having greater than 41 wins would result in an overall winning record (>0.500 win percentage).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I apply the Naive Bayes model to predict if a player will win enough to make the playoffs based on a number of attributes related to on and off court performance.\n"

Using the testing features, I predicted the targets based on the Naive Bayes model and evaluated the accuracy of the model. Based on the individual player features, the model has a 80% accuracy in predicting whether the player's team will make the playoffs. This is a decent result and the accuracy may be misleading because there are many other factors as to why a team would make the playoffs outside of individual statistics. Things like team chemistry and intangible attributes like effort and heart are not quantified here. "

First, I defined the Kfold parameters by providing the number of folds to evaluate, this means that the dataset will be broken up into multiple subsets of the training data (containing the features and the target) and the accuracy of the model will be calculated for each subset to provide an overall accuracy of the model with a confidence interval. \n",

The average accuracy of all 10 folds and the 95% confidence interval was calculated to confirm the accuracy result determined above.\n",
